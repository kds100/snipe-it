# Contribution Guidelines

Please submit all issues and pull requests to the [snipe/snipe-it](http://github.com/snipe/snipe-it) repository in the `develop` branch!

**As you're working on bug-fixes or features, please break them out into their own feature branches and open the pull request against your feature branch**. It makes it _much_ easier to decipher down the road, as you open multiple pull requests over time, and makes it much easier for me to approve pull requests quickly.

If you don't have a feature in mind, but would like to contribute back to the project, check out the [open issues](https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/issues?state=open) and see if there are any you can tackle.

## Translations!

If you're not great at PHP and you still want to help, consider contributing some translation files (assuming, of course, that you are fluent in another language.)

To do so:

* fork the develop branch
* create a new branch on your new fork (something like `translations/french`)
* copy the `en` directory and name it according to the [two-letter ISO 639-1 code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
* translate the strings
* submit a pull request!

**If you've translated Snipe IT into another language already for your own usage, please consider contributing those translation files back to the project so that everyone can benefit.**

Thanks!
